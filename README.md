Assignment 3 Python Challenge

Below is the instructions for the PyPoll and PyBank. Data was provided in a CSV file. Our task was to create a path for the date and analyze the following. The Script should print out in the terminal and create a txt file. 
I struggled greatly with the PyPoll txt file. It currently prints out in the terminal, but it will not print to the txt file. It creates the file, but it does not paste. I worked with multiple BCS chats, tutoring, and with the TA's, but after hours of working I had to leave it the way it is. There is a for loop reading the dictionary within the final print statment that is causing me issues. I think I would need to rewrite my whole process. 

**PyPoll Instructions**
In this Challenge, you are tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process.

You will be given a set of poll data called election_data.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values:

The total number of votes cast

A complete list of candidates who received votes

The percentage of votes each candidate won

The total number of votes each candidate won

The winner of the election based on popular vote



**PyBank Instructions**
In this Challenge, you are tasked with creating a Python script to analyze the financial records of your company. You will be given a financial dataset called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".

Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values:

The total number of months included in the dataset

The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
